My First Machine Learning Program

Things to do..
--------------
Create a list called ListOfPeople
Create a structure/class called "Person/Entry"
Which has fields... { x, y, z}

Now using that data, create a histogram of ages, and all the different categories using the dictionary we made


Things I've done
----------------
+ I know how to create lists (heterogeneous arrays)
+ I know how to make a dictionary (unsorted map)
+ Adding to the list
+ Adding to a dictionary 
+ Separating lines into words with .split()
+ Opening files (I guess relative pathnames are fine?)
+ Reading from files (SUPER EASY holy mackerel)
+ Still rough with for loops (C++ for_each)

Things I've learned
-------------------

Questions I have
----------------
+ What is clustering?

Things I need to improve
------------------------
-- Git stuff --
+ What is git checkout?
+ What are git branches? How do I use them?
+ What about a merge? (I know what a merge conflict is? But why would I do this?)
+ How do I reset to my last commit?
+ What is git remote?
+ I think I know what git diff
+ What is git show?
+ What is git tag?
